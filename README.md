### Instructions
Don't expect this game to work flawlessly. It's a project for a CS exam, and as such it needn't be perfect.
That said, the instructions are simple:
- Set the clock to 64Hz, to calibrate the timer
- Press "Reset" if you think anything is wrong
- Press "Play" to generate the game, and wait for the screen to go blank
- Guess the cards by pressing the corresponding two buttons
- Press "Check"
- When the game ends, just press "Reset" and "Play" again
- Enjoy!
